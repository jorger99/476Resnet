# 476Resnet
Machine Learning 476 @ UMDCP, Cameron/Alex/Angel/Jorge Final Project
We are comparing two strategies for image classification
Using ResNet-50 as a feature extractor to pre-process the data and feed the output into our densely connected network, which will be presented by Cameron
and a convolutional neural net to directly classify the images, which will be presented by Alex
